function c = unlock(p,c)
%REMOVELOCK Removes a lock for the namespace/property path p in the context
%c. For example, to unlock all parameters, call c = addLock('p',c). To lock the
%equations of motion, call c = addLock('d.eqns',c).

%We intentionally avoid using cg and cs to edit locks because otherwise you
%could lock yourself out of c.locks.
